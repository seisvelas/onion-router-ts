# TypeScript Onion Router

This is a learning project to create a minimalist Onion Router in TypeScript.

# How do I use it?

Don't - This is purely educational

`npm run circuit` will start an entry, relay, and exit node. 

Then you can run `npm run client` to make a request. Right now it will just do a request to a hardcoded URL, but you can change that in source/client.ts (I will make it more generalized soon I promise)


## Todo

- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] Make entry point into 'conventional' proxy protocol (like SOCKS5)
- [ ] Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange
- [ ] HTTPS
- [ ] Add hidden services
